How the component works:
Input Handling:
Users can input numbers, which can be separated by commas, newlines, or a custom delimiter (e.g., //;\n1;2).
Add Function:
The add function processes the string input, calculates the sum, and handles errors such as negative numbers.
Form Submission:
On form submission, it calls add(), handles exceptions, and updates the UI with the result or an error message.
Custom Delimiters:
Supports custom delimiters by specifying //[delimiter]\n[numbers].
